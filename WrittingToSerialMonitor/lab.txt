a. Based on the readings from the serial monitor, what is the range of the analog values being read?

0 to 1023

b. How many bits of resolution does the analog to digital converter (ADC) on the Arduino have

1023 resolution


a. What voltage values do you see from your force sensor?

I was able to get up to 575

b. What kind of relationship does the voltage have as a function of the force applied? (e.g., linear?)

I think it's a log relationship

c. Can you change the LED fading code values so that you get the full range of output voltages from the LED when using your FSR?



high impedence, low impedence
